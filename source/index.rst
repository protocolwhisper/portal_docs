Introduction
============
Welcome to Portal's Documentation!
----------------------------------

Portal is a next-generation blockchain oracle service. We offer privacy, scalability, and fast compute at a low cost to users. Portal utilizes the latest advancements in `Trusted Execution Environments` to provide provable, verifiable off-chain compute on any blockchain. We also have the ability to allow developers to code and extend smart contracts in any modern programming language. Our system is interoperable, and we are bringing this power to as many L-1s as possible in order to help all of Web3 reach its full potential. Portal enables use cases from complex DeFi strategies, data analytics, artificial intelligence, and gaming engines to private NFTs and private auctions. All of this is accessible via our easy-to-use interfaces, integrated across a host of popular blockchains.

Portal also has a currency, PRTL, which is used to power our ecosystem. We envision anyone can monetize the latent compute power of their compatible devices by participating as a decentralized oracle node in order to service the future of Web3.



Overview
---------------
Below, we lay out a technical tutorial on how developers can use our smart contracts, currently running on EVM-based blockchains. We go through our most popular demo, which is available on Remix for testing. This demo allows you to understand the archictecture, request testnet PRTL from our faucet, and start using our service and smart contracts to power your Dapps. The below Verifable Random Function (VRF) demo is meant to be an example for how our service works, and we will be releasing more heavy compute oriented demos as we continue development.

Since we are currently building Portal from the ground up, feel free to regularly check for updates and follow us on `Twitter <https://twitter.com/portalcompute>`_ for the latest news about Portal.
